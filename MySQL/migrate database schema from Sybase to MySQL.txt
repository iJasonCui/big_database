1. USE Sybase Power Designer 15 reverse engineering the database objects from Sybase 15.

2. at PowerDesigner, do the "change current DBMS" from Sybase 15 into MySQL 5.0

3. run "generate the database" from PowerDesigner

4. save the database scripts as "crebas.sql"

5. issues

5.1 datetime default getdate() does not work on MySQL. you could use "TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP"
    replace "getdate()" with "CURRENT_TIMESTAMP". But you have to change datetype from "datetime" into "timestamp"
    it's important to note that datetime has a range of 1000-9999, but the range for timestamp is only 1970-2038.
    this can be a problem if your system has to store birthdates, or you have to handle something like the payment
    plan for a 30-year mortgage
5.2 char and varchar over 255 does not supported by MySQL and use Text instead of varchar(255+)
5.3 replace "dbo." with "" (empty string)
5.4 replace "numeric" with "decimal"
5.5 bigint not null auto_increment; decimal(12,0) does not match "auto_increment"

6. execute the sql against MySQL server

mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 4100 -D Plus45 < crebas_Plus45_NoDrop.sql
