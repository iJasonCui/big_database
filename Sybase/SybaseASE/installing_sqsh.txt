sqsh does not compile on ASE 15. We therefore used the compiled version pre ASE15. 


This creates a small issue in that sybase has renamed some of the dynamic libaries.

We need to run the script below to create these links



$SYBASE/OCS-15_0/scripts> lnsyblibs create


This is the README file for the SDK/Open Server scripts.


This directory contains the following script(s):

lnsyblibs:
        As of SDK 15.0 and Open Server 15.0, 
Sybase library names have
        changed from lib<name> to libsyb<name> to avoid name clashes
        
with other libraries.

        To allow pre-15.0 applications to continue to work with the
        
renamed shared libraries, this script is provided to create
        symbolic links from the new library 
names to the old ones in
        $SYBASE/$SYBASE_OCS/(dev)lib.

        
Usage of the script:

          lnsyblibs { create | remove }

        where 'create' makes the symbolic links 
in $SYBASE/$SYBASE_OCS/(dev)lib
      
  and 'remove' can be used to destroy these links again.
