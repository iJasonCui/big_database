1. the general rule of thumb for Sybase IQ is a split of 40% for the main buffer cache and 60% for temp buffer cache.
2. Block size
All I/O occurs in units of blocks. The size of these blocks is set when you
create a Sybase IQ database; you cannot change it without recreating the
database. By default, the IQ page size determines the I/O transfer block size.
For example, the default IQ page size of 128KB results in a default block size
of 8192 bytes. In general, Sybase IQ uses this ratio of default block size to page
size, but it considers other factors also.
The default block size should result in an optimal balance of I/O transfer rate
and disk space usage for most systems. It does favor saving space over
performance.

IQ page size (KB)               Default block size (bytes)
64                               4096
128 (default for new databases)  8192
256                             16384
512                             32768

3. Getting information using stored procedures

Sybase IQ offers several stored procedures that display information about your
database:

? sp_iqconnection displays statistics about user connections and versions
? sp_iqcontext displays information about what statements are executing
? sp_iqcheckdb checks the validity of your current database
? sp_iqdbstatistics reports results of the most recent sp_iqcheckdb
? sp_iqdbsize gives the size of the current database
? sp_iqspaceinfo displays space usage by each object in the database
? sp_iqstatus displays miscellaneous status information about the database.
? sp_iqtablesize gives the size of the table you specify.
? sp_iqgroupsize lists the members of the specified group.
